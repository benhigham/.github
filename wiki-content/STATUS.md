## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: Full Migration (Recommended) ✨

All wiki pages are ready! Migrate everything at once:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/.github/wiki-content
./migrate-to-wiki.sh
```

This script will:

- ✅ Enable wiki in repository settings (you'll need to do this manually first)
- ✅ Clone the wiki repository
- ✅ Copy all 10 wiki pages
- ✅ Commit and push everything

**Then**: Update README.md with wiki links and announce the migration!

### Option 2: Pilot Migration

Start with just a few pages to test:

```bash
# 1. Enable wiki in settings
open https://github.com/benhigham/.github/settings

# 2. Clone and copy just a few pages
git clone https://github.com/benhigham/.github.wiki.git ~/Projects/.github.wiki
cd ~/Projects/.github.wiki
cp ~/Projects/.github/wiki-content/{_Sidebar.md,_Footer.md,Home.md,Getting-Started.md} .

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "docs: pilot wiki migration"
git push origin master
```

**Then**: Test the waters for 1-2 weeks before migrating remaining pages.

## ❓ Questions?

**Q: Can I edit these files?**  
A: Yes! These are your files. Edit them as needed before copying to wiki.

**Q: What if I want to regenerate a page?**  
A: Just ask me and I'll recreate it with the latest content from the repository.

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: No. These files are separate from your repository. Until you update README.md with wiki links, nothing changes.

**Q: Can I preview wiki pages?**  
A: Yes, they're just markdown. Open them in VS Code preview or any markdown viewer.

**Q: What if I want to go back?**  
A: Just don't update the repository files. The wiki is separate. You can delete it anytime.
