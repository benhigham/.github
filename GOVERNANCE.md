# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for this project. As an individual maintainer, I've created this document to provide transparency around decision-making processes and to establish a foundation for sustainable project development.

## Project Vision

This project aims to provide a repository of reusable templates, workflows and documentation for the GitHub platform. The vision is to grow the assets over time to cover more languages, workflows, and applications.

## Current Governance

As the sole maintainer, I currently make all project decisions while actively seeking community input. This includes:

- Feature roadmap prioritization
- Pull request reviews and merges
- Issue triage and management
- Release scheduling and versioning
- Community moderation

## Decision Making Process

Decisions are made with the following principles in mind:

- Alignment with project vision and goals
- Technical quality and sustainability
- User experience and accessibility
- Community input and needs
- Backward compatibility considerations

For significant changes, I will:

1. Create an issue for discussion
2. Solicit feedback from the community
3. Make decisions transparently with clear rationale
4. Document decisions for future reference

## Contribution Process

All contributions are welcome! Please review our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

The general flow is:

1. Open an issue for discussion or select an existing issue
2. Fork the repository and create a branch
3. Make your changes following the code style guidelines
4. Submit a pull request
5. Address review feedback
6. Once approved, changes will be merged

## Maintainer Responsibilities

As maintainer, I commit to:

- Respond to issues and pull requests within a reasonable timeframe
- Provide clear feedback on contributions
- Keep the project documentation up to date
- Ensure the codebase remains sustainable and maintainable
- Foster a welcoming, inclusive community environment
- Handle security issues promptly and responsibly

## Succession Planning

To ensure project sustainability:

- Documentation is maintained to enable future contributors to understand the project
- The project uses standard tools and practices to lower the barrier for new maintainers
- If I become unavailable or step down, I will seek new maintainers through the following process:
  1. Post an announcement in GitHub Discussions seeking interested contributors
  2. Prioritize contributors with a history of quality contributions to the project
  3. Evaluate candidates based on technical skills, understanding of project goals, and community engagement
  4. Provide a transition period where new maintainers work alongside me before full handover
  5. Transfer repository ownership and administrative rights through GitHub's built-in mechanisms
  6. In case of sudden unavailability, contributors with significant involvement may request ownership transfer through GitHub's abandoned repository process

## Code of Conduct

All community interactions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). I am responsible for enforcement and addressing code of conduct violations.

## Communication Channels

- **Issues**: Primary place for feature requests, bug reports, and discussions
- **Discussions**: For general questions and community conversation

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT license. All contributions must be made under the same license.

## Changes to Governance

This document may evolve as the project grows. Significant changes will be:

- Announced via GitHub Discussions
- Open for community discussion before implementation
- Documented with clear reasoning
