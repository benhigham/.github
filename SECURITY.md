# Security

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories
managed through GitHub. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

I will respond indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a
vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security
vulnerability".

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
