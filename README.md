## How It Works

GitHub will use these default files for any public repository under my account that doesn't have its own specific version of these files.

## Using Reusable Workflows

To use any of the reusable workflows in your repository, create a workflow file that calls them:

### Example: CI Workflow

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: benhigham/.github/.github/workflows/ci.yml@main
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      run-lint: true
      run-typecheck: true
      run-test: true
```

### Example: Auto-merge Dependabot

```yaml
name: Auto-merge Dependabot
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    uses: benhigham/.github/.github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml@main
    with:
      auto-merge-patch: true
      auto-merge-minor: true
      merge-method: squash
```

### Example: Release with Changesets

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    uses: benhigham/.github/.github/workflows/release-changesets.yml@main
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      needs-build: true
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Using Shared Actions

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js with pnpm
  uses: benhigham/.github/.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm@main
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    pnpm-version: '8'
```

## Label Management

The `labels.yml` file defines a standard set of labels. You can sync these to your repositories using tools like:

- [github-label-sync](https://github.com/Financial-Times/github-label-sync)
- [GitHub CLI with gh-label](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label)

## Usage

If you're contributing to any of my repositories, please review the guidelines in these files before submitting issues or pull requests.
