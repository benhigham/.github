## Data Flow

Describe how data flows through the system:

1. User initiates action
2. Frontend processes request
3. Backend validates and processes
4. Database stores/retrieves data
5. Response sent back to user

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: [e.g., React, Vue, Angular]
- **State Management**: [e.g., Redux, Vuex, Context API]
- **Styling**: [e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind]
- **Build Tool**: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, Parcel]

### Backend
- **Runtime**: [e.g., Node.js, Python, Go]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Express, FastAPI, Gin]
- **Authentication**: [e.g., JWT, OAuth, Sessions]
- **API Style**: [e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC]

### Database
- **Primary Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL]
- **Caching**: [e.g., Redis, Memcached]
- **Search**: [e.g., Elasticsearch, Algolia]

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: [e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel]
- **CI/CD**: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI]
- **Monitoring**: [e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Sentry]

## Design Patterns

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: How users are authenticated
- **Authorization**: How access control is implemented
- **Data Protection**: How sensitive data is protected
- **API Security**: How APIs are secured
- **Dependency Security**: How dependencies are kept secure

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching Strategy**: What and how things are cached
- **Database Optimization**: Index strategy, query optimization
- **CDN Usage**: How static assets are served
- **Load Balancing**: How traffic is distributed
- **Monitoring**: What metrics are tracked

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: How to add more instances
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource requirements for scaling up
- **Database Scaling**: Sharding, replication strategy
- **Caching Strategy**: How caching helps with scale
- **Bottlenecks**: Known limitations and how to address them

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: What gets unit tested
- **Integration Tests**: What gets integration tested
- **E2E Tests**: What gets end-to-end tested
- **Performance Tests**: What gets performance tested
- **Security Tests**: What security testing is done

## Deployment Architecture

### Environments
- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment
- **Production**: Live production environment

### Deployment Process
1. Step 1: Code review and approval
2. Step 2: Automated tests run
3. Step 3: Build and package
4. Step 4: Deploy to staging
5. Step 5: QA verification
6. Step 6: Deploy to production
