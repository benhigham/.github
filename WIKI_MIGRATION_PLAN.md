# Wiki Migration Implementation Plan

**Project**: Migrate user documentation to GitHub Wiki (Hybrid Approach)  
**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

## 📋 Overview

This plan implements the hybrid documentation approach recommended in `WIKI_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`:

- **Move to Wiki**: User guides (Getting Started, Quick Reference, Advanced Usage, Troubleshooting, Labels)
- **Keep in Repo**: Community health files, templates, README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE
- **Result**: Cleaner repository (11 files vs 17) with better documentation discoverability

---

#### Task 2.7: Create Templates Guide

Create `Templates-Guide.md`:

```markdown
# Templates Guide

This guide explains how to use the template files provided in the repository.

## 📋 Available Templates

The repository provides three template files that you can copy and customize for your own projects:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/benhigham/.github/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Document your system architecture
2. **[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/benhigham/.github/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Development setup and guidelines
3. **[RELEASING.md](https://github.com/benhigham/.github/blob/main/RELEASING.md)** - Release process documentation

## 🚀 How to Use Templates

### Step 1: Copy the Template

```bash
# From your project repository
curl -o ARCHITECTURE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benhigham/.github/main/ARCHITECTURE.md
curl -o DEVELOPMENT.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benhigham/.github/main/DEVELOPMENT.md
curl -o RELEASING.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benhigham/.github/main/RELEASING.md
```

Or manually:

1. Go to the template file in the repository
2. Click "Raw" button
3. Copy content
4. Create file in your repository
5. Paste content

### Step 2: Follow TODO Comments

Each template includes `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comments that guide you through customization:

```markdown
<!-- TODO: Replace [repository-name] with your actual repository name -->
<!-- TODO: Choose your tech stack and delete others -->
<!-- TODO: Update with your actual deployment process -->
```

### Step 3: Remove Template Notice

Delete the template notice at the top of each file after customization:

```markdown
> **Note**: This is a template file. When creating a new repository, 
> copy this file and customize it for your specific project.
```

## 📖 Template Details

### ARCHITECTURE.md

**Purpose**: Document your system's technical architecture

**What to customize**:

- System architecture diagram
- Component descriptions
- Technology stack choices
- Design patterns used
- Security considerations
- Scalability approach

**Best for**:

- Full-stack applications
- Microservices systems
- Complex libraries
- Systems with multiple components

### DEVELOPMENT.md

**Purpose**: Help developers set up and contribute to your project

**What to customize**:

- Prerequisites and versions
- Installation steps
- Project structure
- Available scripts
- Development workflow
- Testing approach
- Code style guides

**Best for**:

- All projects accepting contributions
- Projects with complex setup
- Teams with multiple developers

### RELEASING.md

**Purpose**: Document your release process and version management

**What to customize**:

- Versioning strategy (SemVer, CalVer, etc.)
- Release schedule
- Changeset examples
- Release process steps
- Pre-release workflow

**Best for**:

- Published npm packages
- Projects with formal releases
- Libraries with semantic versioning
- Projects using changesets

## 💡 Customization Tips

### For npm Packages

Keep all three templates and customize:

- ARCHITECTURE.md: Focus on API design and module structure
- DEVELOPMENT.md: Emphasize npm scripts and testing
- RELEASING.md: Detail npm publishing process

### For Web Applications

Customize to emphasize:

- ARCHITECTURE.md: Frontend/backend separation, deployment
- DEVELOPMENT.md: Environment setup, database migrations
- RELEASING.md: Deployment process, rollback procedures

### For Documentation Sites

May only need:

- DEVELOPMENT.md: How to run docs locally, add content
- RELEASING.md: Deployment process

### For Internal Tools

Simplify:

- ARCHITECTURE.md: Keep high-level only
- DEVELOPMENT.md: Focus on quick setup
- RELEASING.md: May not be needed

## ✅ Checklist

After customizing templates:

- [ ] All `[repository-name]` placeholders replaced
- [ ] All `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comments addressed
- [ ] Template notice removed
- [ ] Technology stack choices finalized (delete unused options)
- [ ] Code examples updated with your actual commands
- [ ] Links to your repository/documentation added
- [ ] Reviewed for accuracy and completeness

## 💬 Feedback

What do you think of the new wiki structure? Any suggestions for improvement? Reply below!
```

#### Task 5.2: Update External References (if any)

Update any external documentation that links to the old files:

- [ ] Personal blog posts
- [ ] Social media bios
- [ ] Other repository READMEs that reference these docs
- [ ] Bookmarks/favorites

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these metrics over the next 2-4 weeks:

### GitHub Analytics

- **Wiki Page Views**: Check in Insights > Traffic > Popular content
- **Repository Traffic**: Compare before/after migration
- **Search Queries**: What are users searching for?

### Community Feedback

- **Discussion Comments**: Reactions to migration announcement
- **Issues**: "Can't find X" issues (should decrease)
- **Contributions**: Are wiki edits happening?

### Usage Indicators

- **Navigation Patterns**: Which wiki pages get most views?
- **Time on Page**: Are users staying longer (reading) or leaving (can't find what they need)?
- **Bounce Rate**: Are users finding what they need quickly?

### Target Goals

- ✅ 50% of documentation views shift to wiki within 2 weeks
- ✅ Zero "where is X documented?" issues/discussions
- ✅ Positive feedback in migration announcement discussion
- ✅ At least 5 wiki page views per day (average)

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If the migration doesn't work out, you can easily revert:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Keep Wiki)

```bash
cd ~/Projects/.github

# Restore deleted files from git history
git checkout HEAD~[number] -- GETTING_STARTED.md QUICK_REFERENCE.md ADVANCED_USAGE.md TROUBLESHOOTING.md LABELS.md GOVERNANCE.md

# Revert README changes
git checkout HEAD~[number] -- README.md

# Commit restoration
git add .
git commit -m "docs: restore documentation to repository (wiki experiment)"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Full Rollback (Remove Wiki)

1. Follow Option 1 above
2. Disable wiki in repository settings
3. Delete wiki repository locally
4. Add rollback note to CHANGELOG

---

## ✅ Post-Migration Checklist

After completing all phases:

- [ ] All wiki pages created and accessible
- [ ] All links tested and working
- [ ] README updated with wiki links
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING updated with wiki reference
- [ ] CHANGELOG documents migration
- [ ] Migration announcement posted
- [ ] External references updated
- [ ] Success metrics tracking started
- [ ] Team/community notified
- [ ] Backup of old docs available (git history)

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Do migration in one sitting** - Avoid partial migrations
2. **Test thoroughly** - Click every link, view every page
3. **Communicate clearly** - Make migration obvious in README
4. **Monitor feedback** - Watch for confusion in issues/discussions
5. **Be ready to iterate** - Adjust wiki structure based on usage
6. **Keep templates in repo** - They need to be easily copyable
7. **Use descriptive commit messages** - Makes rollback easier if needed

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check existing wiki pages**: Look for similar content structure
2. **Review GitHub Wiki docs**: [GitHub Wiki Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis)
3. **Test in private repo first**: Create a test repository to practice
4. **Ask in discussions**: Create a discussion if stuck
5. **Rollback if needed**: Use the rollback plan above

---

## 🎉 After Migration

Once migration is complete:

1. **Monitor for 2 weeks**: Track metrics and feedback
2. **Iterate based on feedback**: Adjust wiki structure if needed
3. **Update regularly**: Keep wiki content current
4. **Celebrate**: You've improved your documentation structure! 🎊

---

**Estimated Total Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (better discoverability, cleaner repo)
