# Wiki Migration Analysis

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Context**: Evaluating whether to migrate documentation from repository root to GitHub Wiki

---

## üìä Current State Assessment

### Documentation Overview

We now have **17 markdown files** (~5,000 lines) in the repository root:

| Category | Files | Total Lines | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **User Guides** | 4 | 1,575 | GETTING_STARTED, QUICK_REFERENCE, TROUBLESHOOTING, ADVANCED_USAGE |
| **Reference** | 2 | 804 | README, LABELS |
| **Templates** | 3 | 1,097 | ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, RELEASING |
| **Community** | 5 | 435 | CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT, GOVERNANCE |
| **Meta** | 3 | 722 | AGENTS, CHANGELOG, LICENSE |

### ‚úÖ Goals We Achieved

1. **Progressive Disclosure** ‚úÖ
   - Clear path: Getting Started ‚Üí Quick Reference ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Troubleshooting
   - Each doc serves a specific audience/need

2. **Improved Navigation** ‚úÖ
   - Cross-references and footer links in all major docs
   - Mermaid decision trees for workflow selection
   - Table of contents in long documents

3. **Actionable Templates** ‚úÖ
   - TODO comments guide customization
   - "Choose one and delete others" instructions
   - Multiple examples for different scenarios

4. **Visual Aids** ‚úÖ
   - Workflow selection decision tree (README)
   - Release process timeline (RELEASING)
   - Label selection flow (LABELS)

5. **Reduced Verbosity** ‚úÖ (partially)
   - Split 717-line QUICK_REFERENCE into 4 focused docs
   - But individual docs still substantial (581, 517, 248 lines)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Challenges

1. **Root Directory Clutter**
   - 17 markdown files compete for attention
   - Mixed purposes (guides, templates, meta, community)
   - Harder to find what you need quickly

2. **Discoverability**
   - File-based navigation requires knowing filenames
   - No built-in search across documentation
   - Can't easily browse documentation hierarchy

3. **Maintenance**
   - Every doc edit requires PR + review
   - Higher friction for quick fixes/updates
   - Docs treated as code (good/bad tradeoff)

4. **Still Verbose**
   - QUICK_REFERENCE: 581 lines (still not "quick")
   - ADVANCED_USAGE: 517 lines (comprehensive but long)
   - Combined workflow guides: ~1,600 lines

## üîç GitHub Wiki Evaluation

### What is GitHub Wiki?

- Git-backed documentation system built into GitHub repositories
- Separate git repo (`.wiki` clone)
- Built-in sidebar navigation and search
- Web-based editing with preview
- Markdown support with GitHub-flavored extensions

### Advantages

| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Cleaner Repository** | Move user guides out of root | High - Reduces clutter |
| **Better Navigation** | Built-in sidebar + search | High - Easier discovery |
| **Easier Editing** | Edit in browser, no PR needed | Medium - Lower friction |
| **Proper Separation** | Code vs. documentation contexts | High - Semantic correctness |
| **History Tracking** | Git-based with visual diff | Medium - Track doc evolution |
| **Browse Experience** | Wiki UX optimized for reading | High - Better UX |

### Disadvantages

| Concern | Description | Severity | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **No PR Review** | Changes don't require approval | Medium | Keep critical docs in repo |
| **No CI Validation** | Can't lint/validate automatically | Low | Manual review process |
| **Link Breakage** | Existing .md links would break | High | Add redirects in README |
| **Separate Search** | Wiki search isolated from code | Low | Cross-link appropriately |
| **Offline Access** | Need separate wiki clone | Low | Document wiki clone process |
| **Community Expectations** | Some users expect docs in repo | Medium | Keep README comprehensive |

## üéØ Recommended Approach: Hybrid Model

### Keep in Repository Root

**Community Health Files** (GitHub requires these locations):

- ‚úÖ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ‚úÖ CONTRIBUTING.md  
- ‚úÖ SECURITY.md
- ‚úÖ SUPPORT.md
- ‚úÖ LICENSE.md
- ‚úÖ CODEOWNERS

**Standard Repository Files**:

- ‚úÖ README.md (overview + links to wiki)
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md (standard practice)

**Templates** (need to be copyable):

- ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE.md
- ‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT.md
- ‚úÖ RELEASING.md

**Configuration** (if added):

- ‚úÖ AGENTS.md (AI agent instructions - optional)

### Migrate to Wiki

**User Documentation** (browsable guides):

- üìö **Home** - Overview + quick navigation
- üìö **Getting Started** - 5-minute setup guide
- üìö **Workflows**
  - Quick Reference
  - Advanced Usage
  - Troubleshooting
- üìö **Labels Reference** - Complete label guide
- üìö **Templates Guide** - How to use template files
- üìö **Governance** - Project governance (or keep in repo)

### Updated README Structure

## ü§î Decision Criteria

### Migrate to Wiki If

- ‚úÖ You want cleaner repository root
- ‚úÖ Users need better browsing/search experience  
- ‚úÖ Documentation changes frequently (wiki easier to edit)
- ‚úÖ You have 5+ documentation files
- ‚úÖ You want to separate user docs from code

### Keep in Repository If

- ‚úÖ Documentation rarely changes (prefer PR review)
- ‚úÖ You want docs in code search results
- ‚úÖ Contributors need docs offline in repo clone
- ‚úÖ You have strong CI/CD for doc validation
- ‚úÖ Community expects docs in repository

---

## üí° Recommendation

**I recommend the hybrid approach** for your `.github` repository:

### Rationale

1. **Special Repository Purpose**
   - This is a meta-repository (community health files + workflows)
   - Users come here to copy files and understand workflows
   - Different use case than typical project documentation

2. **Current State Analysis**
   - We successfully achieved progressive disclosure
   - Navigation is good with footer links
   - Main issue is clutter (17 files) and discoverability

3. **User Benefit**
   - Wiki provides better browsing for workflow guides
   - Repository keeps copyable templates accessible
   - README becomes cleaner entry point

4. **Low Risk**
   - Can migrate iteratively (start with getting started guide)
   - Easy to revert if it doesn't work
   - Keep critical docs in repo (CONTRIBUTING, templates)

### Next Steps

1. **Quick Win**: Create wiki with just "Getting Started" page
2. **Evaluate**: See if users find it helpful (track wiki views)
3. **Iterate**: Migrate more docs if successful
4. **Keep Templates**: Always keep ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, RELEASING in repo

---

## üìä Success Metrics

After migration, track:

- Wiki page views (GitHub provides analytics)
- Issues/discussions about "can't find documentation"
- Contribution activity (PRs for doc updates vs. wiki edits)
- User feedback in discussions

**Target**: 80% reduction in "where is X documented?" questions

---

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Will this break existing links to documentation?**  
A: Yes, but we can add redirect notices in README and keep file stubs with links to wiki.

**Q: Can I still edit wiki docs with PRs?**  
A: Yes! Clone the wiki repo (`git clone https://github.com/benhigham/.github.wiki.git`) and submit PRs.

**Q: What about search engines indexing docs?**  
A: GitHub wiki pages are indexed by search engines. May actually improve SEO.

**Q: Should AGENTS.md go to wiki?**  
A: Probably keep in repo since it's for AI tools that read repository files.

**Q: Can I migrate incrementally?**  
A: Absolutely! Start with Getting Started, evaluate, then migrate others.

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

**Start with a pilot migration:**

1. Create wiki with "Getting Started" page only
2. Add prominent link in README
3. Track usage for 2 weeks
4. If successful, migrate remaining docs
5. If not, keep current structure (it's already quite good!)

The current documentation structure is **functional and well-organized**. Wiki migration is an **optimization**, not a necessity. The hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds.
